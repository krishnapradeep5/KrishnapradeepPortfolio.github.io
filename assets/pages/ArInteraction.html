	<P>Experience the next level of immersive gameplay with our innovative Unity project, combining ground detection and real-world interaction. Through cutting-edge technology, this project enables players to seamlessly blend the virtual and physical worlds.</P>
	<p>To initiate the process, users are guided to identify a suitable surface in their real-world environment. Our advanced ground detection algorithms analyze the environment, allowing users to visualize the optimal placement location for their player character. This ensures a smooth and realistic integration of virtual elements into the user's surroundings.</p>
	<p>Once the ideal placement position is established, users can interact with the virtual player character using an intuitive joystick control. By manipulating the joystick, users can navigate the character within the real-world space.</p>
